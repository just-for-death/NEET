## Shapes

1.  Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds.
2.  The sp hybrid orbital contains more s character and hence it is closer to its nucleus and forms shorter and stronger bonds than the sp 3 hybrid orbital. The sp2 hybrid orbital is intermediate in s character between sp and sp3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate betweenthem.
3.  The change in hybridisation affects the electronegativity of carbon. The greater the **s character of the hybrid orbitals,** **the greater is the electronegativity**. Thus, a carbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with 50% s character is more electronegative than that possessing sp2 or sp3 hybridised orbitals.

## Characteristic Features of π Bonds

1.  In a π (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two p orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap.
2.  Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.
3.  Rotation of one CH fragment with respect to 2 other interferes with maximum overlap of p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is restricted.
4.  The electron charge cloud of the π bond is located above and below the plane of bonding atoms. This results in the electrons being easily available to the attacking reagents.
5.  In general, π bonds provide the most reactive centres in the molecules containing multiple bonds.
